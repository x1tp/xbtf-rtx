# X-Universe Tax System Plan (X: Beyond the Frontier Era)

## Overview
This document outlines a proposed tax system for the game, grounded in the lore and ideologies of the five main races of the X-Universe (Argon, Boron, Paranid, Split, Teladi). The system adds depth to the economy, forcing players to adapt their trading strategies based on whose sector they are in.

## Universal Mechanics
While each race has unique taxes, some mechanics are universal across the Gate Network:
*   **Docking Fees**: A standard fee for landing at any station (higher in core sectors).
*   **Gate Tolls**: (Optional) Small automated deductions when passing through specific jump gates, ostensibly for "maintenance."
*   **Sector Security License**: A purchasable license that reduces police scans or tax rates in a specific race's territory.

## Racial Tax Systems

### 1. Argon Federation
**Ideology**: Federal Democracy, Bureaucratic, Survivalist.
**Government**: The Argon Federation.
**Motto**: "For the Federation and the Free Argon."

**The "Federation Defense & Infrastructure Tax" (FDIT)**
*   **Concept**: A standard, progressive tax system similar to modern Western democracies, but heavily skewed towards military funding due to the Xenon threat.
*   **Mechanics**:
    *   **Sales Tax (VAT)**: A fixed percentage (e.g., 5-8%) added to every transaction (buy/sell) within Argon stations.
    *   **War Effort Levy**: An additional surcharge on all wares classified as "Military" or "Tech" (Shields, Lasers, Missiles).
    *   **Haulage Tariff**: Heavy transport ships (TS/TL class) pay a "Road Tax" upon entering core sectors like Argon Prime.
*   **Justification**: "Citizen, your credits fund the fleet that keeps the Xenon at bay. To evade tax is to invite the machines."

### 2. Boron Kingdom
**Ideology**: Pacifist, Royalist, Environmentalist, Artistic.
**Government**: Constitutional Monarchy (Queen Atreus).
**Motto**: "For the Queen and the Kingdom."

**The "Royal Harmony Contribution"**
*   **Concept**: A high-tax system that funds social welfare and environmental stability. It rewards peaceful trade and penalizes aggression.
*   **Mechanics**:
    *   **Luxury Tax**: Extremely high taxes (15-20%) on goods deemed "non-essential" or "aggressive" (Weapons, Space Fuel, Swamp Plant).
    *   **Peace Rebate**: Trading in food (BoFu, Plankton) or medical supplies grants a *negative tax* (subsidy) or tax credits.
    *   **Bio-Conservation Fee**: A small fee for every docking action to "offset engine emission damage" to the local environment.
*   **Justification**: "We must all share the burden to preserve the beauty of the Kingdom. Your contribution helps maintain the peace."

### 3. Paranid Empire
**Ideology**: Theocratic, Supremacist, Mathematical, Xenophobic.
**Government**: Theocracy (Pontifex Maximus Paranidia).
**Motto**: "By the grace of the Xaar."

**The "Sacred Geometry Tithe"**
*   **Concept**: A complex, religiously motivated tax system. Non-Paranid (the "unholy") are taxed heavily unless they prove their worth.
*   **Mechanics**:
    *   **Unholy Surcharge**: Non-Paranid players pay a flat +10% on all transactions unless they have high reputation.
    *   **Dimensional Tariff**: Taxes are calculated based on "Sacred Numbers" (e.g., if the cargo volume is a multiple of 3, tax is lower; if it's a prime number, tax is higher). *Implementation note: Keep this simple for the player, maybe just flavor text for fluctuating rates.*
    *   **Temple Offering**: Buying High-Tech goods (which Paranid excel at) requires a mandatory "donation" to the local temple.
*   **Justification**: "It is only logical that the inferior species tithe to the superior intellect of the Paranid. The Xaar demands it."

### 4. Split Dynasty
**Ideology**: Feudal, Aggressive, Patriarchal, Strength-based.
**Government**: Feudal Dynasties (Council of Families).
**Motto**: "For the Family. For Rhonkar."

**The "Protectorate Tribute"**
*   **Concept**: Less of a "tax" and more of a "protection racket." You pay the local Family for the privilege of not being shot.
*   **Mechanics**:
    *   **Docking Tribute**: High docking fees, paid directly to the station owner (Family).
    *   **Weakness Penalty**: If the player enters a sector in a damaged ship or with low combat rank, taxes/fees are *higher* (because they can exploit you). Strong players pay less respect.
    *   **No Regulation**: Illegal goods (Space Flies, Slaves) are *not* taxed or policed, making Split space a tax haven for smugglers, provided they pay the entry tribute.
*   **Justification**: "You pay Family Rhonkar now. Or Family Rhonkar takes ship. Your choice, creature."

### 5. Teladi Company
**Ideology**: Hyper-Capitalist, Corporate, Neutral.
**Government**: Corporate Syndicate (Chairman).
**Motto**: "Profit!"

**The "Opportunity & Transaction Fee"**
*   **Concept**: The Teladi don't tax "income" (that discourages profit). They tax *movement* and *usage*. Everything has a price tag.
*   **Mechanics**:
    *   **Transaction Fee**: A micro-fee on *every single credit exchanged*. Low percentage (1%), but inescapable.
    *   **Brokerage License**: To buy the best goods, you must buy a temporary "Trade License" for that sector.
    *   **Efficiency Bonus**: If you make a massive profit (high trade volume), the Teladi actually *refund* some fees to encourage you to come back. "Volume discount."
    *   **Seizewell Surcharge**: Trading in the company HQ sector (Seizewell) carries a premium "Prestige Fee."
*   **Justification**: "Tax is waste. Fee is service. You pay fee, you make profit. We both make profit. Good business."
